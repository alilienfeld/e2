    <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Player 1 draws a card then chooses if the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the current card.
        </li>
        <li>Ties count as a win for the player because we are not playing casino rules.</li>
        <li>Aces are represented with 1, Jacks are 11, Queens are 12, and Kings are 13.</li>
        <li>There are no suits but there is a full deck of cards, so four of each card.</li>
        <li>If Player 1 guesses correctly the turn switches to Player 2.</li>
        <li>Player 2 the chooses based on the last card if the next card will be higher or lower.</li>
        <li>The turn rotates until a player guesses wrong.</li>
        <li>The first player to guess wrong loses the game.</li>
    </ul>
