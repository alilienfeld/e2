+ By: Ali Lilienfeld
+ URL: <http://e2p1.hesclassali.com>

## Game planning
+ Create an array of cards in a deck
+ Create an empty array of picked cards
+ Create a player choice for high or low
+ Pick next card from deck to compare
+ Compare if player guess won or lost
+ Switch to player 2 and repeat steps
+ Determine winner based on who guesses wrong first




## Outside resources
+ The rules to Hi-lo (slightly modified) https://www.online-gambling.com/hi-lo/

## Notes for instructor
### Future goals for improvement:
+ Randomize which player gets to start since you can lose on first turn being player 2 has advantage
+ Allow player input (specifically not allowed in this project)
+ Improve my representation of a deck of cards?
